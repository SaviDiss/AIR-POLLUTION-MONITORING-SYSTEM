# AIR-POLLUTION-MONITORING-SYSTEM
IOT Based air pollution monitoring System

This project explains an IoT based Air Pollution detection system. Monitoring air quality is essential for local authorities as well as for major public and private industries to understand and prevent air pollution and measure emission sources, in order to reserve health and donate to the fight against the greenhouse influence. To get the best results from the environment about the pollution level of air, toxicity and harmfulness for human, air quality monitoring device is mostly used. 

The system was developed using the Arduino microcontroller. The air pollution monitoring system was designed to monitor and analyze air quality in real-time and log data to a remote server, keeping the data updated over the internet. This system that constantly keeps track of air quality in an area and displays the air quality measured on an LCD screen.

We used thingspeak. ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service from MathWorks. It  allows you to aggregate, visualize, and analyze live data streams in the cloud. ThingSpeak provides instant visualizations of data posted by our devices or equipment. It  automatically charts the data that we send it, so we can remotely monitor our devices from anywhere.
